Slightly less daunting list of libraries: https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries

Quick icons http://shreyasachar.com/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html - you probably want near 100% white
or http://materialdesignicons.com/ - you probably want to choose the lollipop option when you download

Colors: http://www.materialpalette.com/

HTTP: https://github.com/koush/ion

Logging: https://github.com/orhanobut/logger

Views/input events: https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/

Talking between things that can't easily talk: https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus
If something involves an intent for communicating data, or bundles, or parcelables, its probably easier to just use/
the event bus. Want to sort of store some data that other places might need? Sticky events pretty much work.
